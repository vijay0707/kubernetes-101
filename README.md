## üöÄ Welcome to Kubernetes 101!

**Kubernetes 101** is a beginner-friendly series designed to help you learn Kubernetes (K8s) from scratch. Whether you're new to container orchestration or familiar with Docker, this repository will guide you through the core concepts of Kubernetes with hands-on exercises and real-world examples.

### üìã What You Will Learn:
- What Kubernetes is and why container orchestration is important.
- Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster.
- Kubernetes core components: Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.
- Managing containerized applications using Kubernetes.
- Kubernetes networking, storage, and scaling.
- Using Helm for Kubernetes package management.
- Hands-on projects to solidify your learning.

## üìö Prerequisite

Before diving into Kubernetes, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of containerization and Docker. If you‚Äôre new to Docker, check out our **[Docker 101 Series](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/docker-101-series)** to get started with Docker fundamentals before moving on to Kubernetes.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Basic Command Line Knowledge**: Some familiarity with the command line and Kubernetes is helpful.
- **Install Kubernetes**: Set up a local Kubernetes environment (using tools like Minikube, Docker Desktop, or KIND) or use a cloud provider‚Äôs managed Kubernetes service (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS).

Once you have your Kubernetes setup ready, verify by running:
```bash
kubectl version --client
```
